# PianoBot 🎹 – Autonomous Piano-Playing Robot

PianoBot is an autonomous, LEGO-based robot capable of playing piano keys by interpreting color-coded sheet music. Designed and programmed by a team of three engineering students, the robot combines precise mechanical design, sensor integration, and custom CAD components to achieve smooth and accurate performance.

## 🔧 Overview

- 🎯 **Accuracy:** 92% success rate across 70 notes  
- 🤖 **Actuation:** Two robotic fingers driven by motors and 4 LEGO gears  
- 📏 **Precision Control:** Ultrasonic sensor ensures accurate key strike distance  
- 🎨 **Sheet Music Detection:** Color sensor reads and decodes color-coded notes  

## 🛠️ Key Features

- **Sensor Integration:**  
  Combines an ultrasonic sensor for dynamic range detection and a color sensor to parse visual sheet music input.

- **Mechanical Design:**  
  Robotic fingers with a 75-degree range of motion, powered by 2 motors and supported by a gear train, enabling controlled key presses.

- **Custom Components:**  
  CAD-modeled robotic fingers, motor mounts, and suction rollers designed in **SolidWorks** and **AutoCAD**, then fabricated via **laser cutting** and **3D printing**.

## 📐 Technologies Used

- **SolidWorks / AutoCAD** – Design and modeling of structural components  
- **Arduino (UNO R4)** – Microcontroller for sensor input and motor control  
- **C++ / ROBOTC** – Codebase for logic and motion control  
- **3D Printing / Laser Cutting** – Manufacturing of custom-designed robot parts  

## 🧠 Team & Purpose

This project was developed by a team of three second-year Mechanical Engineering students at the **University of Waterloo** as part of a robotics design challenge. The focus was on blending hardware design, motion control, and sensor feedback in a compact and functional prototype.
